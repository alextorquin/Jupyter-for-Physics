#Jupyter Notebook and SageMathCloud for  Teaching Physics


The presentation I gave to The University of Sheffield's Department of Physics away day in December 2015 is at http://mikecroucher.github.io/Jupyter-for-Physics

The presentation uses Reveal.js and the source is available on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
